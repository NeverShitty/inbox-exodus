# Inbox Exodus

![Inbox Exodus Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150?text=Inbox+Exodus)

A litigation-aware, AI-driven file migration tool designed to extract, classify, audit, and reorganize files and emails from Microsoft 365 (Outlook + OneDrive) into Google Workspace (Gmail + Drive), while preserving forensic chain-of-custody and surfacing legal triggers like contracts, disputes, or litigation signals.

## üîç Problem It Solves

| Problem | How Inbox Exodus Solves It |
|---------|----------------------------|
| üßÉ Old emails/files scattered in Outlook & OneDrive | Pulls and reclassifies into structured Google Drive folders |
| üß† Files with legal value buried in noise | Flags litigation-relevant terms (e.g. TRO, ownership, PTG) |
| üìú Need for forensic audit trails | Generates TOTAL RECALL logs with SHA-256, timestamps, routing history |
| ü§ñ Manual classification takes too long | Uses GPT to auto-classify every file/email by entity, type, purpose |
| üß∫ Duplicates and outdated files everywhere | Deduplicates, archives non-relevant, syncs only canonical versions |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### 1. MS365 Exporters
- üì§ Exports .pst/.eml from Outlook
- üìÅ Downloads entire OneDrive tree

### 2. GPT Classification Engine
- üìä Analyzes file contents (not names)
- Tags by:
  - Business entity (ARIBIA LLC, Jean Arlene Venturing LLC, etc.)
  - File type (Lease, Contract, Receipt, Statement, Creative)
  - Usage (Legal, Tax, Trust, Rental, Archive)

### 3. Litigation Flagging
- Detects content with terms like "ownership dispute," "TRO," "arbitration," "PTG refund"
- Sends flagged files to /SOURCE_OF_TRUTH/LITIGATION_HOLD/

### 4. Total Recall Logging
- Creates an audit trail per file
- SHA-256, GPT tags, source, destination, timestamp, and action

### 5. Three-Phase Workflow
- **Phase 1:** Analyze files
- **Phase 2:** Propose structure
- **Phase 3:** Execute migration after approval
